# ðŸŒŠ Waveform - AI Image Generator

**Waveform** is a desktop application built with Python that allows users to generate images from text prompts using AI. It features a clean, modern interface using `customtkinter`.

This project was created as part of my **Class 12 Computer Science project**.

By default, it uses the **Prodia API** to generate images, but you can modify the API request section in the code to use other services like Stability AI, OpenAI, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

- Takes a text prompt from the user  
- Sends the prompt to an image generation API  
- Downloads the image and displays it inside the app  
- Saves the image locally in the `img_generator/` folder
